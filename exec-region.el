;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs provides many ways to run shell commands. You could, for
;; example, use M-|, or M-!, or eshell. This package provides another
;; option.
;;
;; To use, select a region of text containing the command(s) you wish
;; to run, then run one of the callable commands. The output will be
;; written either to the current buffer or an output buffer, depending
;; on the callable you call:
;;   exec-region-here: write the output to the current buffer after the
;;     region
;;   exec-region-to-new-buffer: write the output to a buffer named by
;;     the value of the `exec-region--output-buffer-name` variable
;;   exec-region-and-replace: replace the region (in the current buffer)
;;     with the output
;;
;; Each callable has a counterpart that will act in the same way but will
;; prepend each command's output with the command that generated it.
;; The function names are the same but with `-with-commands` appended.
;;
;;; Code:

;;
;; Key bindings.
